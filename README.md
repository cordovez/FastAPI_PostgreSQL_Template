# FastAPI_PostgreSQL_Template
⚠️ ... Attention: As of 27 Feb 2024 this is a work in progress ... ⚠️

This is a boilerplate template for scaffolding backend APIs using SQL databases.

It is intended to be a learning tool for beginners (like myself), who wish to explore how to handle and work with relationships between rows in tables.

In contrast, I hope to eventually create a duplicate API to use with MongoDB (a Non-SQL db) to see the value and/or difficulties with working with each type.

This is by no means a production-ready CRUD API. There are still many functions to add. Nevertheless, it offers a good foundation from which to build your own, with some basic changes to the setup. My objective has been to try to make it clear and intuitive.

## The Project Prototype
Imagine you own a language school and you want to manage all your data in a dashboard that is available to all users.

The users can be students, teachers, school staff, and administration staff. These roles also reflect the authorization levels and what data is available to each.

I deally, you should be able to not only **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete users, but you should also be able to **CRUD** the courses you offer
and likewise be able to handle enrollment in these courses.

A calendar view would be the cherry on the cake!
